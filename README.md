# PSO_MobileAntenna_MN
The mobile screen ratio is getting bigger and biger. This is a big disavantage for antennas' radiation performances. Concretely, radiation efficiency could be reduced significantly if the ground clearance (the area not covered by screen) is shink from 5mm width to 2mm.
Matching Network (MN) is a well-known solution for the case. The idea is that the separated design processes for antenna and MN could not provide the optimal results. This work will study the hybrid design process: antenna geometry is optimised in paralle with optimal MN calculations.

Matlab plays control and verification roles. HFSS will check EM perfomance of designs. Optenni Lab provided optimal MN for each design.
